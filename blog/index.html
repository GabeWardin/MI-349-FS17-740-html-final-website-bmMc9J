    <h1>Galactic Conquest Blog Series: December 2017</h1>

    <p>
      Despite all the intergalactic hopping in science fiction and the occasional extraordinary research claim, most of us have accepted that when it comes to travel, humanity is always going to be limited by the speed of light. Of course, we haven't managed to accelerate anywhere near light speed as yet, but even if we could, Einstein's theory of relativity clearly states that nothing can surpass it. <br>But astrophysicist Geraint Lewis from the University of Sydney gave a talk last night explaining that, in theory at least, super-fast warp speed travel is possible according to Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity. We just need to find the right materials to achieve it. To achieve warp speed, it won't be our rockets that we need to upgrade. Instead we'll need to find a material that has a negative density energy. Although this is not certain, we strongly believe this energy exists in our sun. What we do know, is that we have the proper technology to harvest this energy when we are able to confirm its existence in our sun. <br>Even travelling at the speed of light, it would take four years to go to the nearest star and 2 million years to go to the nearest large galaxy. These distances would stop you colonising the Universe ... so you would need some sort of way to beat that speed limit, and Einstein's theory of relativity gives it to you.<br> We are extremely close to light speed travel, in fact, we project to have completely cracked the code of light speed travel within the next three to four years. However, light speed travel isn't our end goal, as warp speed travel is our ultimate goal, and we are extremely confident that we will be there sooner rather than later.
